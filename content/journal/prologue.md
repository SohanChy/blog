I started poking around HTML since I was in 7th grade. 
I wanted to make my own web pages so I was snooping around Google to see how that was possible. The first few lines of HTML that I wrote were most probably a link with a a:hover effect, When I opened my page on a browser and the mouseover effect worked, I remember being excited like the little kid I was, and even showing my brother what I had accomplished. I really started having fun when I started learning php and jquery,

What started out as a curiosity turned into me typing away at my keyboard hours on end, night would come, bedtime would pass and I wouldn't even notice. 
I had to kill off my coding interests from grade 10 through 12 because of  the way our education system is. Everything, the future of your life basically depends on these 4 grades and you have to kill anything else but study from your mind.

Which I tried to do but still didn't succeed in becoming one of the BUET,CUET,...IAN'S. 
Yeah, in that sense, I am a failure. But whatever, IDGAF. At least not anymore.

Benjamin Franklin said "Some people die at 25 and aren't buried until 75."


People search for a passion all their life. I think I have found mine. So I'm going to try my best to pursue it. I'm getting back to doing stuff that I actually have an interest in.
I'm learning more low level languages, starting with C. Brushing up my rusted Web Development skills. Trying to stay focused, and waiting to see where that takes me. :)
